## My Tribute Page - Dave Grohl

This was one of the requirements towards applying for the School of Code (the bootcamp I greaduated from) - before we had any formal development experience.

Its a simple HTML landing page tribute to anyone we wanted to acknowledge. I have always been a fan of the Foo Fighters band and so I decided to create a simple and fun tribute to Dave Grohl, the front man of the band.

While this is by no means the most impressive project you'll come across, it's one that marked the start of my journey to becoming a junior developer and one I'll always look at with fond memories.

I am incredibly lucky for the opportunities ive been given and every step of my journey is as important to me as the next ðŸ™‚
